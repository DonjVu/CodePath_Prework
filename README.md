## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
My friend helped me with wrapping my head around how the game logic should be implemented.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The majority of my time was spent implementing the gaming logic. I am still new to web development and game development so I had trouble getting started. However once I understood the results of my different test cases,
I understood the line of logic I had to folow

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I had question of how to optimize webpages and games for mobile usage? I was wondering if there is a seperate or additional procedure that needs to be done to allow compatability
with IOS or android devices? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would probably be doing more additional features in order to improve the quality and aesthetics of the game. I had very little time due to my awareness of this opportunity
being on the week of my midterms and a week before submissions were due. However, with the additional time I would have definitely added more features such as a control for 
the volume and better aesthetics for the button such as a theme for the entire page.
