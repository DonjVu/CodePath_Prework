Memory Game is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Donald Vu**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/pattern-shining-garage?path=README.md%3A7%3A17

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A
2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The majority of my time was spent implementing the gaming logic. I am still new to web development and game development so I had trouble getting started. However once I understood the results of my different test cases, I understood the line of logic I had to follow. I did not have much time to do the prework. However, I believe I would have trouble implementing a timer. This would require me to make a visible counter appear at the beginning of the round and reset every time a new round starts. Further, the timer would end the game once the timer is up. I would have to do a lot of self-studying in order to build the timer since I don't have a lot of experience in HTML. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I had a question about how to optimize webpages and games for mobile usage? I was wondering if there is a separate or additional procedure that needs to be done to allow compatibility with IOS or Android devices? I want to learn the lifecycles of the development of website and games in order to familiarize myself with the procceses in web development. I first started coding with python and java, so I don't have a good grasp of HTML, CS, and JS just yet. I have been exposed to those tools when I created a website to serve as my portfolio, however, I did use a lot of boilerplate code in order to style my portfolio. I do look forward to learning more about web development, especially on the front end. Furthermore, this project has encouraged me to learn JS in roder to strengthen my web development, but also explore different stylings in CSS.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would probably be doing more additional features in order to improve the quality and aesthetics of the game. I had very little time due to my awareness of this opportunity
being on the week of my midterms and a week before submissions were due. However, with the additional time I would have definitely added more features such as a control for 
the volume and better aesthetics for the button such as a theme for the entire page. Futhermore, I would have liked to add a timer and a radomizer to the game. I believe a timer and a randomizer would make it the game much more interesting and allow me to explore HTML's syntax further and help me practice developing game logic. I would have definitely added more buttons and added images to the buttons. Adding images and more buttons would probably help me learn how to design websites for other projects as well. In the end, I wish I had more time to do the pre-work and I hope I will be able to do more work like this in the future.
